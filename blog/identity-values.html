        <h1>Identity, Values and Strengths</h1>
        <h2>My personal values</h2>
          <div class="questionBlock">
            <p class="question">A situation where I had an ethical decision to make. What values did I weigh up? What were the consequences of my action?</p>
            <p class="answer">My best friend and I were going out and he made a bulge in his parents car when trying to park it. It was not for granted that he could use the car (It was quite a nice one) so we decided to blame forces outside of our control and agreed to tell his parents it was a deer.<br> 
              Next day his father confronted me with the question of whether I had an idea of what was the cause for the bulge. I had the choice to <br>
              <br>
              a) lie and be dishonest or <br>
              b) tell the truth and be anti-loyal to my friend!<br>
              <br>
              I went for b). 
              It turned out that the father already new the truth and just wanted to test my values (so mean). I have really struggled to make that decision as both "friendship/loyalty" and "honesty" are important values for me. Looking back I still do not know which choice was better but I have learned that I am a terrible liar ;-)

            <p class="question">How my culture has influenced my values and identity.</p>
            <p class="answer">
            I have grown up with a relegious background. This heavily influenced my internal belief- and value-system from the start. I have spent the last 10 years to get conscious about those internalised values and beliefes and started to reshape them.

            <p class="question">An example of where I have tried to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. What strategies did I use at that time, how effective were they and my reflection on what other strategies I would try now and why</p>
            <p class="answer">
              I have experienced many of those situations in my work life in my role of a project / product manager. An introvert by nature, I tend to prescribe the plan and make the team follow the path. If the team cannot figure it out themselves I tend to take the challenge away from the team, go into my cave, figure it out, come out and tadaaaa present the solution. This is anti-collaborative and anti-agile and causes frustration, people feeling undervalued, losing buy-in and motivation. It works well in war / command-chain like situations but it's not a good approach for solving complex problems. Agile problem solving requires cross-functional collaboration, committement and alignment of the challenge and autonomy to execute. It's not "build a bridge", it's "we need to cross the river, let's figure out how".
