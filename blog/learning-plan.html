            <p class="question">My long term goal and career pathway?</p>
            <p class="answer">
                I want to earn my daily bread in a way that does not exhaust me since what I do is in-line with my Ikigai:

            <p class="answer">
            I believe becoming a web developer brings me much more close to the center of this diagram.<br>
            My goal in the professional area (intersection of green and blue) is to earn the status of a senior developer within 5 years.

            <p class="question">My strenghts and limitations in relation to learning</p>
            <p class="answer">
            Strenghts:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>I have an analytical mind which helps me to understand new material</li>
                    <li>I do have pre-knowledge and experience which makes it easier for me to associate new with existing knowledge.</li>
                    <li>I am a disciplined learner</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="answer">Limitations:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>I get tired really fast which makes it harder to work through new content and it affects memory.</li>
                    <li>I have some bad memories from past learning experiences. Sometimes this leads to small panic attacks which hinder my ability to absorb new knowledge if not addressed.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="questionBlock">
            <p class="question">What human skills I would like to see developed in myself while at Dev Academy</p>
            <p class="answer">I'd be proud if I could achieve this single one: Become more of a co-creator and co-learner instead of work and learn in isolation.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="questionBlock">
            <p class="question">My committement to how I will manage my workload in this programme to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives</p>
            <p class="answer">
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Respectful:</strong> I have understanding of other people ideas, their situations and if life gets in the way.</li>
                    <li><strong>Helpful:</strong> I listen more than talk /explain (although this is hard for me ;-)). I help to the best of my capabilities.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flexible:</strong> I do not have kids or any other significant responsibilities at the moment. This allows me to be flexible in managing work and time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Approachable:</strong> I am responsive and receptive to questions. I give and ask for honest feedback.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reliyable and punctual:</strong> I show up when it's expected for team meetings and lectures and I meet deadlines.</li>

            <p class="question">What I will do when things are building up and starting to get to me</p>
            <p class="answer">
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Physical:</strong> Do something active or some form of body relaxation</li>
                    <li><strong>Mental:</strong> Switch the type of task - getting away from the computer to go and discuss ideas with another student for example</li>
                    <li><strong>Emotional:</strong>  Doing something fun or pleasurable will provide a positive emotion boost</li>

        </div>
        <div class="questionBlock">
            <p class="question">How and where I will seek help in a timely way</p>
            <p class="answer">I first give it a try myself. If I cant find a solution right away I'll browse the internet. If I am still stuck I reach out to a peer with a clear problem statement and description of which approaches I have tried and what current behaviour is. If this still does not help, reach out to class. Then to facilitator or tutor.</p>

        <div class="questionBlock">
            <p class="question">What I expect from the facilitation team</p>
            <p class="answer">
                <ul>
                    <li>Unblock students if they are stuck. Not necessarely by providing the right solution but by helping to find it.</li>
                    <li>Emotional support and encouragement if times are tough</li>
                    <li>Establish and enforce a safe place and clear structure for communication and learning</li>

        <div class="questionBlock">
            <p class="question">My block-out times</p>
            <p class="answer">
                <ul>
                    <li>I try to keep screen-time between 8:30 am and 7 pm. If I spend time on screen, solving problems I found that it's becoming increasingly difficult to fall asleep.</li>
                    <li>No work / study after 9pm (even if off-screen). This is a hard limit.</li>
                    <li>My preference is to have a late lunch but this is negotiable. Also as an introvert lunch time is a good way for me to recharge my batteries by being with myself</li>
